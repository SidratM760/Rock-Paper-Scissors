# Stratify - Smart Rock-Paper-Scissors Bot

This project is a Python-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game designed to play against a set of predefined bots with distinct strategies. The objective is to develop a bot that can analyze past moves and predict the opponent's next move, achieving a win rate of at least 60% across multiple matches. The project is part of a challenge on freeCodeCamp and includes various algorithms to outsmart the opponent bots.

Features:
- Adaptive strategies to counter different bot behaviors
- Performance tracking with win rate analysis
- Easy-to-use and customizable player function
